# IBM Cloud HPC (Spectrum Symphony)

IBM Spectrum Symphony allows you to deploy high-performance computing (HPC) clusters that use IBM Spectrum Symphony as the HPC scheduling software. This offering uses open source Terraform-based automation to provision and configure IBM Cloud resources. With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. IBM Spectrum Symphony also supports auto-scaling for certain cluster configurations, so worker nodes can be automatically added and removed from a cluster based on workload requirements. This allows you to take full advantage of consumption-based pricing and pay for cloud resources only when they are needed. In addition, this offering supports use of IBM Spectrum Scale for applications requiring a high-performance file system for sharing of data.
